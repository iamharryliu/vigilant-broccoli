Cooking together
I don't understand what's the meaning of cooking together. For me it feels like Kristina cook things and Harry does minor thing while Kristina does the heavy lifting. The things that I do during that time feel very meaningless and minor. Also the kitchen space is pretty tight so it makes it difficult for both of us to navigate the kitchen at the same time. The frustration of cooking together stress plus being hungry is another thing tacked on that makes the situation frustrating for me.

I do understand that it is me fault too for not reading the recipe or knowing everything ahead of time so that I can predict what's your needs at every step of the recipe.
