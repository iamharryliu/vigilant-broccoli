## What is a frontend

- clientside

## Dont's

- Never store secrets in a clientside application.

## HTML

Used to create and organize the building blocks of a web page. Think headers, paragraphs, tables, navbars, footers, etc.

## CSS

Used to style a web page. Think color, font, spacing, size, borders, etc.

## Frameworks

### Angular

- full fledged framework
- opinionated
- has out of the box features to get started

### React

- a library
- less opinionated
- generally requires using other dependecies (libraries, tools, etc..)
