## Alain de Botton’s The Consolations of Philosophy

| Problem                     | Philosopher           | Core Idea                                                                                                                                                       |
| --------------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Unpopularity**            | **Socrates**          | Don’t be afraid of going against popular opinion if you are guided by reason and moral integrity. Live examined, principled lives rather than chasing approval. |
| **Not Having Enough Money** | **Epicurus**          | True happiness comes from simple pleasures, friendship, and freedom, not wealth. Learn to distinguish between natural and unnecessary desires.                  |
| **Frustration**             | **Seneca** (Stoicism) | Much suffering comes from our own expectations. Focus on what you can control and accept what you can’t.                                                        |
| **Inadequacy**              | **Montaigne**         | Accept your humanity and imperfection. Self-knowledge and self-acceptance make life more bearable.                                                              |
| **A Broken Heart**          | **Schopenhauer**      | Love is often driven by nature’s reproductive agenda, not rational choice. Understanding this can reduce bitterness when relationships fail.                    |
| **Difficulties**            | **Nietzsche**         | Suffering can be a source of growth and meaning. “What doesn’t kill you makes you stronger” — embrace hardship as part of self-overcoming.                      |
