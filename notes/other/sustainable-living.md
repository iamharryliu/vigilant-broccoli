## Ways I Save Money

### Sale Tracking Applications

- [Flipp](https://app.flipp.com/) for local grocery stores.
- [camelcamelcamel](https://camelcamelcamel.com/) for Amazon.
- [Karma](https://www.karmanow.com/) for retail purchases.

### Food

- Home Cooking - An amazing skill to possess and saves lots of money being able to satisfy your cravings within your household.
- Paying attention to grocery store sales using applications like Flipp(mentioned earlier)
- Eat out only when outside meals are worth it such as the following scenarios:
  - Really yummy food.
  - Having a meal with good company.
  - Actually hungry. Sometimes I'll eat a light meal to hold myself down until I can get home to eat.

### Transportation

- Sharing a city bike share service to have easy available transportation throughout the city.

### Retail

- Mostly buy secondhand instead of retail.
- Selling things secondhand when you do not need them anymore.
- Purchasing retail:
- Buying retail things that I know will retain its value.
  - Check for return policy to make sure you have options in case you realize you made a purchase mistake.
  - Purchase multiple sizes/colors if returns are possible so that you cantry them out if you do not get the chance in store.
- Watching for sales using notification trackers such as camelcamelcamel for Amazon and Karma for retail sales.

### Services

- Sharing online services with people.
- Purchasing prepaid phone services.

### Other

- Cutting your own hair.
  - Not hard if you are not doing a very detailed haircut or do not care about the freshest cut.
  - Takes time to get used to cutting hair, understanding the tools you need to use and understanding how to cut the styles you want.
