# Kitchen Cleaning

- Dough - Leave sticky dough residue out to dry before washing. Removing dry dough residue is a lot easier than trying to remove sticky wet dough.

## Dishwasher

### Tips
- Add prewash in addition to the pod, ie putting a dab of dish washer detergent directly into the machine.
- Run hot water before starting machine.
- Loading machine properly.
- Running 2 loads a day? A full load and a half load.
