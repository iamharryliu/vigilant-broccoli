# Crispy Black Bean Tacos

## Ingredients

- **Filling**
  - 56g walnuts, broken up into pieces
  - 227g cremini mushrooms, roughly chopped
  - 20g nutritional yeast
  - 1 tsp porcini mushroom powder (optional)
  - 425g can black beans
  - 42g olive oil or avocado oil, more for cooking tacos
  - 20g garlic, finely chopped
- **Taco Spices**
  - 1 tbsp chili powder (2 tsp for less heat)
  - 1 tbsp ground cumin
  - 2 tsp smoked paprika
  - 1½ tsp dried oregano (or Mexican oregano)
  - ¾ tsp kosher salt
  - ~10 twists of black pepper
  - 120g mild salsa, strained of excess liquid
- **For serving**
  - 8 to 12 taco-sized flour tortillas
  - 100g to 150g shredded vegan cheese
  - 5-Minute Chipotle Crema (or Avocado Crema)
  - Lime Pickled Onions (optional)
  - 100g shredded lettuce

## Instructions

- **Prepare Lime Pickled Onions** (if using) beforehand for maceration.
- Preheat the oven to 218°C. 
- In a frying pan, toast walnuts over medium-low heat until golden brown, about 5 minutes. 
- Drain and rinse black beans; pat dry with a towel.
- Blend toasted walnuts in a food processor until finely crumbed. Add mushrooms, nutritional yeast, and mushroom powder, blending until finely chopped.
- Add black beans to the mixture and pulse 10 times to break up but leave some beans intact.
- Heat remaining oil in the frying pan over medium heat, sauté garlic for 2-3 minutes until fragrant.
- Stir in taco spices, cooking for 20-30 seconds, then add the bean-mushroom mixture and cook for 5-7 minutes.
- Stir in salsa and cook for 1 minute, then season with salt.
- **Assemble the tacos**: Spread ~¼ cup of the mixture onto one side of each tortilla, top with cheese, fold, and seal edges.
- Arrange tacos on an oil-brushed baking sheet, brush tops with oil.
- Bake on the bottom rack for 8-12 minutes until golden brown. Flip and bake for an additional 5 minutes on the top rack until crispy.
- Allow to cool slightly, then fill with Chipotle Crema, Lime Pickled Onions, and shredded lettuce.
