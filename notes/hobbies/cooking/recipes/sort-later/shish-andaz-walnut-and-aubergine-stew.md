## Ingredients

- Aubergines
  - 900g aubergines
  - 28g salt
- Base
  - 60ml extra virgin olive oil (plus more if needed)
  - 200g large onion
  - 300g walnuts
  - 5g cinnamon
  - 2.5g freshly ground black pepper
  - 2.5g turmeric
  - 50g tomato paste
  - 60g pomegranate molasses
- Liquid
  - 500ml cold water
  - 200g ice cubes

## Instructions

- **Peel the aubergines in alternating stripes**, then cut into 2cm cubes and sprinkle with 14g of salt. Toss and set aside in a colander.
- Heat 60ml of olive oil in a large casserole over medium-low heat. Finely chop the onion and sauté until translucent (8-10 minutes).
- Add the walnuts to a food processor and blend into a coarse paste.
- Add the ground walnuts to the onions and sauté for 1-2 minutes until aromatic.
- Stir in the cinnamon, pepper, turmeric, tomato paste, pomegranate molasses, and the remaining 14g salt. Cook for another minute.
- Pour in 500ml of cold water and add the ice cubes. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer covered for 30 minutes.
- Heat another 60ml of olive oil in a non-stick frying pan. Squeeze the aubergine pieces to remove excess liquid and fry in batches until golden (10-15 minutes per batch). Transfer to a plate.
- Add the fried aubergine to the stew and gently stir. Cook covered for an additional 10 minutes until ready.
