# Hand-Pulled Noodles

## Ingredients

- **Dough**
  - 350g bread flour
  - 210ml water
  - salt

## Instructions

- Blend together dough ingredients to make dought (60% hydration)
- Turn the mixture onto a clean surface and knead until smooth (10-15 minutes) or use a stand mixer with a dough hook (5-7 minutes).

- Brush a baking sheet with oil, divide the dough into two pieces, roll each piece into a **30cm by 10cm** oval, brush with oil, and transfer to the baking sheet. Cover with plastic wrap and let rest for **3 to 6 hours**.
- Bring a large pot of well-salted water to a boil, reduce to a simmer, and prepare another greased baking sheet or platter.
