# The Illiad by Homer

- no one wants to be at the war but the gods incite them with excitement for bloodlust and battle
- Agamemnon is a dick taking Achilles' war prizes. Achille's throws a temper tantrum because of this and sits out most of the Trojan war.
- Athena tracking down Aphrodite and bullying her which results in Aphrodite running to Hera and crying to her about it
- Zeus reprimanding Aries for toiling in human affairs and telling him he pretty much hates him and Aries snitching on Athena and telling Zeus that he plays favorites
- It is so bullshit how Menalaus and Paris agree to have a dual to conclude the Trojan war but Aphrodite rescues Paris from his death
- Athena persauading that Trojan guy to shoot an arrow at Menalaus to reinitiate the war
- Why the fuck does Achilles' not go out himself when he sends out Patroclus in his armour to beat bach the Trojans. Was he that upset that he couldn't go out for a quick stroll and return to doing nothing??
- So interesting how the most appealing thing to do when a warrior dies is to claim his armour.
- The fight over Patroclus' body was very brutal, the man's body was treated like a game of capture the flag.
- Agamemnon blaming the gods for influencing his decision during the beginning of the war to upset Achilles and offering to return everything to Achilles while Achilles doesn't give a fuck about the loot and just wants to go on a killing rampage.
- That one son of Paris who was captured and sold off by Achilles who ends up facing Achilles again during his bloodlust shortly after freeing himself
- During the dual between Achilles and Hector, Hector suggests that they respect each other's dead bodies and return them to their respective parties which Achilles replies no and drags his body around on horses after defeating him with the hope of feeding him to the dogs to honour Patroclus which doesn't happen because the gods protect Hector's body from harm
- I would cry if I was Hector to throw a spear and have it come back to my feet like a boomerang
- Hector's worship is so well regarded by the gods that his body was not defiled by Achilles' temper tantrum
- The Trojans mourn Hector's body for 12 days which the gods have given them as vouchsafe until the Greeks come in and wreck them
