1. **Threat of New Entrants**  
   - Low entry barriers → more competition.  
   - High threat reduces profitability.

2. **Bargaining Power of Suppliers**  
   - Few/unique suppliers → stronger power.  
   - Can raise prices or reduce quality.

3. **Bargaining Power of Buyers**  
   - Many alternatives or large-volume buyers → more power.  
   - Pushes for lower prices & better quality.

4. **Threat of Substitutes**  
   - Alternative products/services that meet the same need.  
   - High threat limits pricing power.

5. **Industry Rivalry**
