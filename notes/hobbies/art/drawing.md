# Drawing

## Rule of Thumb

- Use light pressure
- Focus more on what you're drawing then what's on paper (thoroughly study the subject).
- Get proportions down first and double check everythin (analyze more and take more time in beginning)
- If drawing with pencril, draw from left to right if you can to avoid smudging
