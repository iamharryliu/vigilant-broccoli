## Hot Takes

- Test Driven Development (TDD) - Onely useful if you know most of the requirements beforehand otherwise code is subject to change which means written tests are also subject to change.
- Behavior Driven Development (BDD) - Cool idea for readable tests but adds extra layer to writing
- ChatGPT - Just another tool like Google search engine. Raised the entry bar of becoming a software developer since it can perform what most junior engineers can do.
