### ðŸŽ¨ UI Technologies & Libraries Explained

- **CSS** â€“ A style sheet language used to describe the visual presentation of HTML elements. It controls layout, colors, fonts, and responsiveness of web pages.
- **SCSS** â€“ A superset of CSS that adds features like variables, nesting, functions, and mixins. Part of the **Sass** preprocessor, making complex styles more manageable and reusable.
- **Bootstrap** â€“ A popular CSS framework offering pre-built components (buttons, forms, modals) and a responsive grid system for quick and consistent UI development.
- **Tailwind CSS** â€“ A utility-first CSS framework where elements are styled using predefined classes (e.g., `p-4` for padding). Highly customizable and helps maintain design consistency.
- **Radix UI** â€“ A set of low-level, unstyled **React** components (modals, dropdowns, sliders) that are accessible and fully customizable to match any design system.
- **ShadCN UI** â€“ A collection of pre-styled **React** components built with **Radix** and **Tailwind CSS**, combining flexibility and quick development for modern UIs.
