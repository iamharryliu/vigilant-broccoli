# Software Breakdown

- **POC**
  - Interfaces > utils > tests > implementation > scaling
- **Data structures**
- **Security**
- **Project Management**
  - Managing Expectations and Deadlines
  - Cost Management

- **Architecture**
  - Microservices - Breaking applications into tiny remote services that run independently of each other.
    - Pros: Developers/teams are able to work on independent services without affecting each other.
    - Cons: Services that are dependent on other services require code changes on both services.
  - Systems Design
    - Integrated system vs independent systems
- **Web Development**

  - **Communication**
    - Socket - Live communication, ie data hydration and live notifications/alerts.
    - RabbitMQ - Asynchronous tasks, can implement rate limits and retry logic. Useful for microservices.
