  - **CQRS** – Separates read and write operations; seen in EventStore and Axon Framework.
- **Microservices** – Builds systems as independent services; used in Netflix and Kubernetes.
- **Monolith** – A single unified codebase; common in traditional Django and Rails apps.

## API Architecture

- **SOAP** – XML-based protocol; used in legacy enterprise systems like Salesforce.
- **REST** – Resource-based with HTTP methods; used in GitHub and Twitter APIs.
- **GraphQL** – Query-based API for flexible data retrieval; used by Facebook and Shopify.
- **gRPC** – High-performance RPC framework; used in Kubernetes and TensorFlow.
- **WebSocket** – Bi-directional communication; used in Slack and Discord.
