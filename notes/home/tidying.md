# Tidying

## Marie Kondo Approach

- Tidy by Category, Not Location: Focus on organizing by category (e.g., clothes, books) rather than going room by room. This helps you see the full extent of what you own in each category.
- Follow the Right Order: The order matters in her method:
  1.  Clothes
  2.  Books
  3.  Papers
  4.  Komono (miscellaneous items)
  5.  Sentimental items
- Discard items that you are ready to let go.
- Store items vertically for visibility.
- Use simple storage methods.
- Having a place for everything.
