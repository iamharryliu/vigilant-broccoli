# Bread

## Sourdough Starter

- donâ€™t overfeed : 2:1:1, 1:1:1 should be max (starter:water:flour), if you put too much flour and water compared with starter, you are diluting acidity and thus preventing good bacteria and yeast to thrive!

## Round Bread

- 2:1 flour to water, add spoons of water if needed to make sure just damp
- yeast and salt
- no knead
- tucks and pulls as needed
- let the dough rest up to 24 hours
- flour surface and tuck dough into a ball
- optional: proofing bowl
  - spray with water and coat with flour
  - let bowl dry for an hour
  - let dough rest in bowl
- drop dough onto parchment and transfer baking pot
- optional: cut design into dough
- bake for 30 minutes with lid on and additional 10 minutes for color (more or less depending on preference)

## Flat Bread

- 3:1 flour to water
