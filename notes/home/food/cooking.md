# Cooking Notes

## Rule of Thumb

### General

- prepping (things to do before starting cooking)
  - read and understand recipe at least once
  - know how long the recipe takes to make
  - have all ingredients and resources ready
  - check proportion sizes and guestimate too
- while cooking
  - always taste if you have the opportunity
  - always add less, you can always add but canâ€™t subtract

### Mushrooms

- cut half inch slices and completely evaporate moisture before continuing to cook

### Noodles

- Always pre-boil noodles to make more workable.
- Rinse noodle in cold water after boiling to stop cooking.
