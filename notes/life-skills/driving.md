### Starting and Moving

- Press the clutch all the way down with your left foot
- Start the engine and shift into first gear
- Slowly release the clutch while gently pressing the gas - you'll feel a "bite point" where the car starts to move
- Once moving, fully release the clutch and continue accelerating

### Shifting

#### Shifting Up

- Ease off the gas
- Press the clutch down fully
- Move the shifter to the next gear
- Release the clutch smoothly while reapplying gas

#### Shifting Down

- Same process, but match your speed to the lower gear - you might need a bit more gas as you release the clutch to keep things smooth.

### Stopping and Parking

- Press the clutch down before you come to a complete stop (or the engine will stall), then shift to neutral.
- Parking - Park in gear with emergency brake on.
