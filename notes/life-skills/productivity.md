    - Less tabs - Limit the amount of tabs you have open because you will just end up not being able to find a tab later. Instead use bookmarks or some other method to keep links organized like a list of some sort somewhere. The way I handle tabs is as follows:
      - **Useless tabs**: Close tabs that are of no further use.
      - **For Later**: Bookmark the ones of interest to me in the bookmarks tab but I don't intend to look at anytime soon. I organize these bookmarks later into folders or markdown notes.
      - **For Soon**: Leave the ones that I intend to use sometime soon but otherwise review later and follow process again.
