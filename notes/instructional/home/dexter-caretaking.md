# Dexter Caretaking

## Feeding

- Feed every other day one the odd days of the month (1, 3, 5, 7, 9...)
- Feed the size of his head at most.

## Water Change / Refill

1. Scoop out pitchers of water into a bucket and pour out water.
2. Refill water to at least the height of the bottom of the top black frame.
   - **If refilling with tap water add a drop of tap water conditioner.**
