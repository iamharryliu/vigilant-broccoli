### Tabs

- Multitabs, just don't. I think It's okay to have a few unorganized tabs open here and there but if you start having over 20 tabs open that seems kind of ridiculous to me. Most browsers have tab groups that you can use now to bucket tabs into groups. I would use groups labeled 'Entertainment', 'Cooking', 'Language Learning' etc..

You can also take advantage of the bookmark manager if you want the tab but don't feel like categorizing it immediately. My flow goes something like Can I organize right now? Yes, put in correct bookmark. No or too lazy, save to bookmarks bar or 'For Later' bookmark folder.
