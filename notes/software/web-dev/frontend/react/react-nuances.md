# React Nuances

- React Classes vs Functions - Functions are the preferred way of writing React as they align with modern React patterns and practices.
- React Redux vs React Hook and React Context - Use React Redux for large scale applications and Use React Hooks and React Context for simple smaller applications.
- Arrow functions vs regular functions - Arrow Functions are the preferred way of writing React to avoid 'this' binding issues as it preserves the 'this' context.
