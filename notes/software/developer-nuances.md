## psycopg2 vs psycopg2-binary

- The binary package is a practical choice for development and testing but in production it is advised to use the package built from sources, whereas
- Building psycopg requires a few prerequisites (a C compiler, some external development library packages)
- SQL vs noSQL vs GraphQL
- ORM vs Raw SQL Queries
