# Tech Lingo

- CPU bound and IO bound

## Hardware

- ARM (Advanced RISC Machine) is a family of energy-efficient processors based on a Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC) architecture.

## Hot Takes

- Test Driven Development (TDD) - Onely useful if you know most of the requirements beforehand otherwise code is subject to change which means written tests are also subject to change.
- Behavior Driven Development (BDD) - Cool idea for readable tests but adds extra layer to writing
- ChatGPT - Just another tool like Google search engine. Raised the entry bar of becoming a software developer since it can perform what most junior engineers can do.

## Network Lingo

- Content Delivery Network (CDN) - A content delivery network or content distribution network is a geographically distributed network of proxy servers and their data centers. The goal is to provide high availability and performance by distributing the service spatially relative to end users.

## Tools

- Elastisearch - Open source search and analytics engine.
- Redis - Open source in-memory datastore used for database caching.
- Hadoop

  - Storage - Hadoop Distribute File System. Has copies of data on multiple systems making it fault tolerant.
  - MapReduce
    - Splits data into parts and processes it in different nodes for load balancing and saving time.
    - Map, Reduce, Shuffle
  - Yet Another Resource Manager(YARN) - Resource management and scheduling

- Runtime - Refers to the environment in which a program or application is executed.
- Monorepo
- Frontend
- Backend
- Package Manager
- Bundler
- Compiler
