# Tech Lingo

- CPU bound and IO bound

## Hardware

- ARM (Advanced RISC Machine) is a family of energy-efficient processors based on a Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC) architecture.

## Hot Takes

- Test Driven Development (TDD) - Onely useful if you know most of the requirements beforehand otherwise code is subject to change which means written tests are also subject to change.
- ChatGPT - Just another tool like Google search engine. Raised the entry bar of becoming a software developer since it can perform what most junior engineers can do.

## Network Lingo

- Content Delivery Network (CDN) - A content delivery network or content distribution network is a geographically distributed network of proxy servers and their data centers. The goal is to provide high availability and performance by distributing the service spatially relative to end users.

## Tools

- Elastisearch - Open source search and analytics engine.
- Redis - Open source in-memory datastore used for database caching.
- Hadoop

  - Storage - Hadoop Distribute File System. Has copies of data on multiple systems making it fault tolerant.
  - MapReduce
    - Splits data into parts and processes it in different nodes for load balancing and saving time.
    - Map, Reduce, Shuffle
  - Yet Another Resource Manager(YARN) - Resource management and scheduling

- Javascript
  - Monorepo Tools
    - Nx
    - Turborepo
    - Lerna
  - Frontend Frameworks
    - Nuxt - Opinionated Vue.
    - Next - Opinionated React.
  - Package Managers
    - npm - Node Package Manager
    - yarn - Installs packages simultaneously
    - pnpm - Uses global store for dependencies.
  - Bundlers - Bundle and transpile for builds.
    - Webpack
    - Rollup - More optimized than Webpack.
    - Vite (build tool, uses Rollup to bundle)
    - esbuild
  - Compiler - Transforms Typescript to Javascript
    - Babel
    - SWC (Speedy Web Compiler)
    - tsc - Does not bundle/optimize code.
