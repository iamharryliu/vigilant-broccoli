# Script Writing

- File structure
```
- main script
- README
  - consts
  - types
  - utils
  - logger
    - info/debugging
    - errors
    - performance
  - apis
```
- Script should start from a main function.
- Consider design for development vs production script (what APIs can the dev environment access?)
