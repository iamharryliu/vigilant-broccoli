# Physics

- Classical vs Modern Physics
  - `Classical physics` is the study of matter and energy on an everyday scale of observation. It is concerned with the works of physicists such as Isaac Newton and James Clerk Maxwell, as well as others.
  - `Modern physics` deals with the study of matter and energy at very high speeds or on very large or small scales.
  - Issues:
    - Gravity's immediate act on a mass
  - Difference between Newtonian and Eistein physics differs negligibly under regular circumstances.
- General Relativity
  - Curved space time that creates gravity as objects follow the bends of spacetime.
  - The more mass an object has the more spacetime is warped.
  - Light
- Special Relativity
  - Space and time are proportional to one another, ie the faster an object moves the slower time passes for that object.
- Blackholes
  - Event horizon
- Waves

  - Light Waves
    - Wave Lengths
      - Wave Length Spectrum
        - Red light: longest wavelengths (~620-750 nm)
        - Orange: ~590-620 nm
        - Yellow: ~570-590 nm
        - Green: ~495-570 nm
        - Blue: ~450-495 nm
        - Violet: shortest wavelengths (~380-450 nm)
      - Shorter wavelengths (violet/blue) carry more energy per photon than longer wavelengths (red). This is why UV light (even shorter than violet) can damage skin, while infrared (longer than red) we primarily feel as heat.
