## Personal Reminders

- use light pressure
- focus more on what you're drawing then what's on paper (thoroughly study the subject)
- get proportions down first and double check everythin (analyze more and take more time in beginning)
- if drawing with pencril, draw from left to right if you can to avoid smudging
