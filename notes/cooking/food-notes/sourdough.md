## Starter

- **Feeding**
  - **Developing a New Starter**
    - Avoid overfeeding when developing a new starter. A maximum ratio of 2:1:1 or 1:1:1 (starter:water:flour) is recommended. Adding too much flour and water dilutes acidity, inhibiting the growth of beneficial bacteria and yeast.
    - Feed the starter once per day.
  - **Maintaining a Starter**
    - Once the starter is strong and healthy, it can be refrigerated for several days. When feeding, a 1:2:2 ratio can be used if preferred.
