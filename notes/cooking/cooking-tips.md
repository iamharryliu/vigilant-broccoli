# Cooking Tips

- Multiple food flavor profiles to create diversity.

# Cooking Reminders

- **Before Cooking**
  - Make new recipes in **smaller batches** to sample/test.
  - Read the recipe to understand what you are dealing with.
    - How long the recipe takes to prepare?
    - What ingredients need to be prepped?
    - What are the proportion sizes?
- **While Cooking**
  - Taste while you cook.
  - Do not overcrowd the cooking vessel.
    - Use a wider base pot for pots that require evaporation such as rice.
  - Clean as you go.
  - Always start by adding less. You can always add later but cannot subtract.
  - Be mindful of:
    - Residual heat.

## Sauces

- For **Asian sauces**, add sauce first and **reduce until thick** before adding other ingredients.
- **Add garlic later** in the cooking process to avoid burning it.

## Vegetables

- **Thinly slice mushrooms** and allow **to expel most of its moisture** before continuing adding oils or other ingredients.

## Cooking Nuances

- Conventional Ovens vs Convectional Ovens
  - Conventional ovens feature heating elements on the top and bottom of the oven cavity.
  - Convection ovens have these elements in addition to a fan that helps circulate hot air throughout the oven cavity.
