# Bread

## Hydration

The ratio of water to flour in bread making, ie 80% hydration meants 80 grams of water to 100 grams water.

### High Hydration

A high ratio of water to flour, typically resulting in a dough that’s wetter and stickier(75+% hydration). This produces bread with an airy, open crumb and a crispy crust, though it can be more challenging to handle. High-hydration doughs often need longer fermentation to develop strength and flavor. They’re popular in artisan baking for the unique texture and taste they provide.

## Types of Flour

- **All-Purpose Flour**

  - Protein Content: 9-12%
  - Characteristics: Versatile and moderately high in protein, all-purpose flour is suitable for many types of bread. However, it may not provide as much structure as bread flour for high-rising loaves.
  - Uses: Ideal for making quick breads, flatbreads, and softer yeast breads.

- **Bread Flour**

  - Protein Content: 12-14%
  - Characteristics: High protein content gives bread flour excellent gluten-forming abilities, resulting in more structure and elasticity in the dough.
  - Uses: Perfect for yeasted breads like baguettes, sourdough, and rolls, where a chewy texture and strong crumb are desired.

- **Whole Wheat Flour**

  - Protein Content: 13-14%
  - Characteristics: Made from the entire wheat kernel, it has a nutty flavor and higher fiber content. Whole wheat flour creates denser, heavier loaves and absorbs more water, so recipes often require extra hydration or a combination with other flours.
  - Uses: Good for hearty breads like whole wheat sandwich bread or multigrain loaves.

- **Rye Flour**
  - Protein Content: 5-10% (lower gluten)
  - Characteristics: Low in gluten, rye flour yields a dense, earthy bread with a slightly sour flavor. Rye - flour often requires blending with other flours for a lighter texture.
  - Uses: Used in traditional rye or pumpernickel bread, ideal for dense, flavorful loaves.
