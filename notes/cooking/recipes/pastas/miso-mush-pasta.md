# Miso Mushroom Pasta

Miso mushroom pasta - 20 minute to make! She's speedy and delicious. I always have miso in my fridge as miso soup is one of my fave breakfasts but adding miso to noodles/pasta is also very delicious.

## Ingredients

Serves 4

- 400g pasta
- 100g shiitake mushrooms
- 300g chestnut mushrooms
- 6 garlic cloves
- 10g fresh ginger
- 1 banana shallot
- 2 tbsp butter
- 4 tbsp crispy shallot chilli oil + 2 tbsp of just oil (from the chilli oil jar)
- 3-4 tbsp miso paste (saltiness and flavour can depend on brand)
- 150ml single cream
- 1 tbsp soy sauce
- 1 lemon
- 2 tbsp honey
- 20g fresh coriander
- 15g garlic chives
- Salt and pepper, to taste

## Instructions

- Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil, add the pasta and cook until al dente. Reserve the pasta water and add a tbsp of just the oil (from the chilli oil) to the pasta to prevent sticking.
- While the pasta cooks, slice the mushrooms. Also, mince the garlic and thinly slice the ginger and shallot.
- In a large wok/pot over medium-high heat, add butter and the sliced mushrooms and fry until they release moisture and start to brown.
- Push the mushrooms to the edge of the wok to create a gap in the centre. Add a tbsp of just the oil from the chilli oil to the centre of the wok along with the garlic, ginger and shallot and saut√© until fragrant and slightly golden.
- Add miso along with two ladles of reserved pasta water and stir until the miso dissolves.
- Add the drained pasta to the pan along with the double cream, soy sauce, juice of a lemon, honey and four tablespoons of chilli oil.
- Toss everything together until the pasta is coated and the sauce is creamy. Add more pasta water if needed.
- Turn off the heat and stir in the chopped coriander. Plate up and garnish with extra chilli oil and sliced chives.
