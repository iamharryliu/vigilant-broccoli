## Ingredients

- Flour
- Water
- Sourdough Starter
- Salt

## Instructions

- **Make Dough**
  - In a large bowl, roughly mix together **flour, water, sourdough starter, and salt**, then let rest for **10 minutes**.
  - Using **wet hands**, knead the dough into a smooth ball, ensuring all the flour is incorporated. Let rest for **30 minutes**.
  - Lightly spray water on a surface, then stretch the dough into a **thin, transparent window**. Fold it onto itself in thirds **vertically** and **horizontally**.
- **Bulk Fermentation (First Rise)**
  - Let the dough ferment **at room temperature or in the fridge** until it has **approximately doubled in size**.
- **Shaping**
  - **Pre-shape** the dough by tucking it into itself to create a taut ball. Let rest for **10 minutes**.
  - **Final shaping**—form the dough into its final shape for proofing.
- **Proofing (Second Rise)**
  - Place the dough in a **banneton** and proof for **1 hour 30 minutes** at room temperature.
  - The dough is ready to bake at this stage, but you can **refrigerate it** for extended proofing to develop more flavor or until you're ready to bake.
- **Baking**
  - **Preheat** the oven to **230°C** with the **Dutch oven inside**.
  - Once preheated, remove the Dutch oven and lower the temperature to **220°C**.
  - Sprinkle a generous amount of **rice flour** in the Dutch oven to prevent the dough’s bottom from overheating.
  - Place the dough on a baking sheet and score it at a **45° angle** to encourage a nice ear during baking.
    - _Optional: Add additional scoring for artistic design._
  - Lift the baking sheet and place it into the **cast iron**.
    - _Optional: Spray the dough generously with water to encourage blistering before baking._
  - Cover with the lid and bake for **15-20 minutes**.
  - Remove the lid and bake for an additional **15 minutes**, or until the crust reaches your desired color.
- **Storage**
  - Cut in half and store in dutch oven, leave lid slightly open for first few hours so that excess moisture can escape.
