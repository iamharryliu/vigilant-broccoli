# Homemade Miso Soup

## Ingredients

- Dashi (Japanese soup stock)
  - 960 ml water
  - 1 piece kombu (dried kelp; 10 g)
  - 240 g katsuobushi (dried bonito flakes)
- Miso Soup
  - 200 g soft/silken tofu (kinugoshi dofu, cut into 1.3 cm cubes)
  - 60 g miso (use 18 g for every 240 ml of dashi)
  - 15 g dried wakame seaweed
  - 1 green onion/scallion (chopped)

## Instructions

- **Prepare the dashi:** Add 960 ml water and 1 piece of kombu to a medium saucepan. Soak the kombu if you have time, then bring it to a slow boil over medium-low heat. Remove the kombu before it becomes slimy and add 240 g katsuobushi to the kombu dashi. Bring back to a boil, then simmer for 30 seconds.
- Strain the dashi through a fine-mesh sieve to get roughly 960 ml of Awase Dashi.
- **Add miso paste:** Bring the dashi to a slow boil (about 96 °C), then turn off the heat. In a ladle, add 60 g miso and a bit of the hot dashi, stirring to dissolve completely.
- Carefully add the dissolved miso to the dashi.
- Add the cubed tofu and 15 g dried wakame seaweed to the pot.
- Lastly, add the chopped green onions just before serving.
- **Serve immediately** while hot.
