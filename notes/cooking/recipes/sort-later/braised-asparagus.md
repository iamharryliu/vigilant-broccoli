# Braised Asparagus

## Ingredients

- **Vegetables**
  - 450g asparagus, trimmed and peeled (if desired)
- **Cooking Ingredients**
  - 30ml vegetable oil
  - 250ml low-sodium chicken or vegetable stock
  - 45g unsalted butter
- **Seasoning**
  - Kosher salt (to taste)
  - Freshly ground black pepper (to taste)

## Instructions

- Heat vegetable oil in a 30 cm straight-sided sauté pan over high heat until lightly smoking.
- Add asparagus in a single layer, season with salt and pepper, and cook without moving until lightly browned, about 1.5 minutes.
- Shake the pan and cook until browned again, 1.5 minutes longer.
- Add stock and butter to the pan and immediately cover.
- Continue to cook until asparagus is completely tender and stock and butter have emulsified and reduced to a shiny glaze, 7 to 10 minutes.
- If stock evaporates and butter starts to burn before asparagus is cooked through, top up with a few tablespoons of water.
