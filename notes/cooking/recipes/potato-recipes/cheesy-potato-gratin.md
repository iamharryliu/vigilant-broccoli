# Cheesy Potato Gratin

## Ingredients

- Cheese
  - 3 ounces finely grated Gruyère or comté cheese
  - 2 ounces finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
- Cream Mixture
  - 2 cups heavy cream
  - 2 medium cloves garlic, minced
  - 1 tbsp fresh thyme leaves, roughly chopped
  - Kosher salt and black pepper (to taste)
- Potatoes
  - 4 to 4½ pounds russet potatoes, peeled and sliced ⅛-inch thick on a mandoline slicer (7 to 8 medium)
- Other
  - 2 tbsp unsalted butter

## Instructions

- Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 200°C.
- Combine cheeses in a large bowl. Transfer ⅓ of the cheese mixture to a separate bowl and set aside.
- Add cream, garlic, and thyme to the remaining cheese mixture. Season generously with salt and pepper.
- Add potato slices to the cream mixture and toss with your hands until every slice is coated, ensuring to separate any slices that are sticking together.
- Grease a 2-quart casserole dish with butter. Organize a handful of potatoes into a neat stack and lay them in the casserole dish with their edges aligned vertically. Continue placing potatoes until all are added, tightly packed.
- Pour the excess cream/cheese mixture evenly over the potatoes until it comes halfway up the sides of the casserole.
- Cover the dish tightly with foil and transfer to the oven. Bake for 30 minutes.
- Remove the foil and continue baking until the top is pale golden brown, about 30 minutes longer.
- Carefully remove from the oven, sprinkle with remaining cheese, and return to the oven. Bake until deep golden brown and crisp on top, about 30 minutes longer.
- Remove from the oven, let rest for a few minutes, and serve.
