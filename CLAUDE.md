- Code implementation:
  - Prefer simple code implementation.
  - Avoid writing documentation.
  - Avoid comments and blocks, only if really necessary do inline comments.
  - Avoid try catch blocks.
  - Avoid string literals, prefer having consts

Follow above guidelines unless explicitly asked otherwise.
