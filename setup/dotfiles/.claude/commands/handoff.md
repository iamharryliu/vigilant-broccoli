Steps:

Check if HANDOFF.md already exists in the project
If it exists, read it first to understand prior context before updating
Create or update the document with:
Goal: What we're trying to accomplish
Current Progress: What's been done so far
What Worked: Approaches that succeeded
What Didn't Work: Approaches that failed (so they're not repeated)
Next Steps: Clear action items for continuing
Save as HANDOFF.md in the project root and tell the user the file path so they can start a fresh conversation with just that path.
