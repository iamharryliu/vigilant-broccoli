# Welcome to DocsMD

DocsMD is my personal library of markdown notes randing from software to cooking.

## Usages for this project:

- These documents are mainly used for quick personal notes that I can pull up on the text editor which I am on quite a bit as a software developer
- If I'm on the go, for example on a grocery run, I will always have my food recipes via cellular network
- Easy place to share these documents with people if they ever need it for any reason.
- Exercise notetaking skills and technical writing capabilities.
