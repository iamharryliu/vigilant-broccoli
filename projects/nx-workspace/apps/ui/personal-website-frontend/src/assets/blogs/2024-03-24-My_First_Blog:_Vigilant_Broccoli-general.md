# My First Blog: What's a _vigilant-broccoli_? ðŸ¥¦

<sup>Sunday, March 24, 2023</sup>

Welcome to my first blog on _harryliu.design_. First things first, a quick introduction. I am a software developer from Toronto, Canada and have a strong passion for anything that peaks my fancy which has led me to pursuing many different hobbies. Weightlifting, rollerblading, iceskating, guitar, coding, taking care of aquariums, skateboarding, choreo dancing, latin social dancing, freesytlye rapping, djing, drawing, cooking (mainly bread baking, my current love) to name a a good chunk of them(and now blogging I guess?).

There's many things I want to write about but I guess I'll start by telling about the purpose of my blog series but to do that I'll first have to tell you about **_vigilant-broccoli_**.

### **_What is vigilant-broccoli?_**

_vigilant-broccoli_ is my personal monorepo (a topic I will write about in the future), essentially a compilation of code and documents written by me, bundled up into a folder and stored somewhere on the internet. That includes this blog, everything on _harryliu.design_ and more. What you're lookng at _is vigilant-broccoli_. The original intention of _vigilant-broccoli_ was to be more or less a software development toolkit (similar to a toolbox for a repairman) containing things from generic base applications built on popular technologies, code snippets, sandbox environments, etc.. but it became more than just that.. Also if you're curious, the name _vigilant-broccoli_ from a random name generator when I initially created the repository on Github(a place code people put code).

### What _vigilant-broccoli_ means to me:

- **As a career and hobby:** First and foremost _vigilant-broccoli_ is where I exercise my enthusiasm for software development. It's where I work on my craft, writing code, and building things that I feel like. _vigilant-broccoli_ has gotten to the point that it not only makes my software development life easier but more enjoyable.
- **In my personal life**: _vigilant-broccoli_ grew to be more than just a software development toolkit, it has became more involved in my personal life in ways that I did not expect at the time of starting the codebase. _vigilant-broccoli_ has integrated with my personal lifestyle and hobbies, containing documentation for my interests such as cooking recipes and notes, code scripts that I use to make enjoying my hobbies easier, and productivity tools for my life to manage thoughts and time management.

_vigilant broccoli_ is an extension of myself, it's the ten thousand hours plus of work that have I put into coding, wrapped up into about 20Mb of data, it's my interests, hobbies, a lifestyle tool, a safe space, and a project that I will probably work on for years to come hopefully.

So with the explanation of _vigilant-broccoli_ out the way I can address why I am blogging. I think it comes down to these 3 key reasons:

#### 1. A way to express myself through personal writing.

I always liked the idea of writing but pen and paper hasn't really been my jam since I'm a slow writer and I think my penmanship looks like chicken scratch. Though I'd I'll still opt for pen and paper for very personal things that I wouldn't want to share with the world because I still like the thought of journaling emotions through hand.

#### 2. Sharing my insights and personal hobbies.

I always wanted to participate more in my hobbies but didn't know how. So this is an outlet for me contribute my insight on everything. I always read other people's content but I create none myself. With a blog I'll be able to express my thoughts on my hobbies at a deeper level and hopefully reach people who may find it interesting or useful.

#### 3. Another damn coding project.

It's a bit of give and take here. Writing the code to make this blog tool feeds my coding hobby and the blog tool itself feeds my creative writing which also is going to fuel the mental engagement with my other interests through the topics I'm going to blog about. I really do get a kick out of writing lines of code and writing a blog too seemed fun enough. ðŸ˜…

Like _vigilant-broccoli_ my blog series is a work in progress and probably going to get a bit of a makeover to make it look a bit less ugly. If you read this far I appreciate your interst and hope you were able to take something away from it. Feel free to share your opinion on my blog series, would love to hear what you have to say. Until next time.
