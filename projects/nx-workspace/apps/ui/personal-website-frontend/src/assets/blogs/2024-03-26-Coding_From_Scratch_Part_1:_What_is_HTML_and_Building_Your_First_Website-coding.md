# Coding From Scratch: What is HTML and Building Your First Website

At the base of any website there is some sort of implementation of **HTML**. HTML is base building block of visual components for web browsing, it is used to create and organize the building blocks of a web page. Think headers, paragraphs, tables, navbars, footers, etc.

Let's get into it and build our first _website_.

- open a text editor of your choice on your computer
- save the file on your Desktop as hello-world.html
- inside enter the following text

```
<h1>Hello World, this is my first website</h1>
<hr/>
<p>This is a paragraph in my website</p>
```

- Double click the hello-world.html file on your Desktop and voila, you have created your first webpage!

HTML is a block style language written in what they call **tags** that **open and close** like the **&lt;h1></h1>** used and **self enclosing tags** such as the **&lt;hr/>** tag used. For a complete list of the different types of HTML tags you can use checkout the link in the _References_ section.
