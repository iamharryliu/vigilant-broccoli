# The Friction of Life

There's plenty of things that I can zone in on and do for hours on end but there are just as much or more that I can't

There is always a lot of friction when trying to do something new ie cooking, woodwork, even working on new code that I am unfamiliar with.

THe truly disciplines ones are the ones who can push themselves to do something that they genuinely do not like doing and sustain it for long durations of time with focus and concentration. Does that even exist??
