# Cloud8

Cloud8 is a Toronto-based skating collective with a mission to live our best skate lives. You can usually find us goofing around at [The Bentway](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Aqu6WuqkiFAagZEK8) or [College Park](https://maps.app.goo.gl/BEv617tQgPUvRZGW8). We are passionate for all types of skating and styles, inline skating/rollerblading, rollerskating/quadskating, and ice skating.
