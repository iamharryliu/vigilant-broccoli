# Skate Terminology

- **Inline Skates** - Skates with wheels arranged in a single line. Often associated with "Rollerblades," the brand that popularized this style.
- **Rollerblades/Rollerblading** - The term "rollerblading" comes from the brand name "Rollerblade," the first company to produce and popularize inline skates. The name "Rollerblade" combines "roller" (referring to the wheels) and "blade" (suggesting the single line of wheels akin to the blade of an ice skate).
- **Rollerskates/Quad Skates** - Skates with four wheels arranged in a rectangular pattern, two in the front and two in the back.

## Inline Skate Terminology

### Mounting

Mounting refers to the type of connection on the boot to which the frame attaches. The mounting type determines frame compatibility with the boot.

#### Types of Mounting

- **UFS (Universal Frame System)**
  - Commonly used for aggressive skating to accommodate a grind block.
- **2 Point Mount (165mm or 195mm)**
  - Traditional mounting systems measured by the distance between the mounting points.
- **Trinity Mount**
  - Most commonly found on Powerslide brand boots, offering a lower center of gravity and better power transfer.

### Frames

- **Frames** - The structure that holds the wheels of inline skates, attaching them to the boot. Frames vary in design based on the type of skating they are intended for, such as aggressive, urban, freestyle, or speed skating.

#### Types of Frames

- **UFS Frames**
  - Compatible with the Universal Frame System, typically used in aggressive skating.
- **Wizard Frames**
  - Known for their length and rocker, designed for freestyle and urban skating.
- **Endless Frames**
  - Versatile frames suitable for multiple wheel configurations, often used for urban and distance skating.
- **Big Wheels**
  - Frames designed to accommodate larger wheels (typically 100mm or more) for high-speed and distance skating.

# Wheel Setups

- **Rocker** - A wheel setup where the middle wheels are lower than the outer wheels, creating a curved profile that enhances maneuverability and agility, often used in freestyle and urban skating.
- **Anti-Rocker** - A wheel setup with two larger outer wheels and two smaller inner wheels (often plastic or grind wheels), providing a stable base for grinding in aggressive skating.
- **Flat** - A wheel setup where all wheels are the same size and touch the ground equally, offering a balanced combination of speed, stability, and control.
- **Quad Skates** - Skates with four wheels arranged in a rectangular pattern, two in the front and two in the back, providing stability and ease of maneuverability, commonly used for recreational skating, derby, and artistic skating.
