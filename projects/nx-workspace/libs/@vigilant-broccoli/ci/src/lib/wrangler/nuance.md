# Wrangler Pages nuances

## `wrangler pages deployment list --json` is capped to one page (25 items)

The command always returns at most 25 deployments, even when more exist. There
is no CLI flag to page past this. Consequences:

- Re-listing after a delete batch can still show 25 items even though real
  deletions succeeded — the next page's deployments slide into view.
- Any "did the count go down?" stale-detection is unreliable for projects with
  more than ~25 deployments.
- A loop that keeps deleting until the list count drops below `keep` can run
  for a long time (many delete calls) on a project with a large backlog,
  because the list never visibly shrinks below the page cap until the real
  total does. In CI this risks hitting the job timeout.

`WranglerService.pruneDeployments` deliberately does a **single bounded pass**:
list once (at most 25 IDs), delete everything beyond `keep` from that one
page, and stop — it does not loop to convergence. A project with a large
backlog needs multiple separate prune runs (e.g. one per deploy) to fully
drain, each clearing roughly one page's worth beyond `keep`.

Observed while pruning `cloud-8-skate-angular`: two consecutive
single-pass `prune-deployments` runs (keep=10) each deleted a page's worth
of distinct deployments successfully, yet `wrangler pages deployment list --json`
reported exactly 25 both times, before and after — confirming the list is
capped rather than the prune being stuck.

Also affects `WranglerService.deleteAllDeployments` (full project teardown):
its `runCount` helper uses `jq length` on the same capped list, so the
"count stuck" detection there has the same blind spot. It loops rather than
single-passing because full teardown has no deploy-critical-path timeout
pressure, so a bounded number of stale-batch retries is an acceptable trade-off
there — do not change `pruneDeployments` to loop the same way.
